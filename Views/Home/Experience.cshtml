<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Sales Prediction Android App</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Built a production-grade Android forecasting App in Kotlin, integrating a FastAPI ML backend deployed on
		Render (Consumer Behaviour ML) to deliver real-time sales quantity predictions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Implemented Room-backed caching and forward prediction logic, cutting redundant API calls by ≈70%
		while ensuring consistent results across app restarts and offline recovery.
	</li>
	<li>
		Integrated Jetpack Compose UI components with ViewModel layers, delivering a responsive and
		intuitive user experience with real-time data updates and state preservation across configuration changes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Designed a multi-stage prediction resolution pipeline (cache hit → re-prediction → forward simulation),
		handling edge cases across monthly rollovers with 100% crash-free execution.
	</li>
	<li>
		Engineered a fault-tolerant Retrofit layer with structured error propagation (Result<T>), preventing UIthread blocking and surfacing actionable failure states.
	</li>
	<li>
		Structured the app using MVVM + Repository architecture, enabling safe iteration across a 50+ file codebase
		and reducing feature update time by ≈50% through clear responsibility separation.
	</li>
</ul>



<h3>Consumer Behaviour ML</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Built a Python-based consumer behavior prediction system on a ~51,000-row dataset, enabling single-row and
		batch (≤500) sales quantity predictions via a REST API.
	</li>
	<li>
		Developed end-to-end ML pipeline with XGBoost and Random Forest, achieving R² = 0.71, MAE = 50.38, RMSE
		= 135 for quantity predictions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ensured model reliability with 5-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and robust input validation
		for 100% inference safety.
	</li>
	<li>
		Optimized batch inference to process 500 rows in ~23 seconds on 8GB RAM, demonstrating efficient
		performance on low-resource hardware.
	</li>
	<li>
		Containerized with Docker for deployment-ready infrastructure, compatible with local or cloud
		environments (GCP, AWS).
	</li>
</ul>



<h3>Role-Based ERP Workforce App</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Developed a role-driven Android ERP system in Java supporting 2 user roles and 5 operational modules,
		ensuring 0 UI thread blocking during business workflow execution.
	</li>
	<li>
		Built relational storage with SQL-backed Room Persistence Library, maintaining 100% data integrity across
		linked workforce records.
	</li>
	<li>
		Automated attendance scoring and loan-deduction pipelines, handling 300+ attendance logs/week, executing
		payroll matches in ≤5s, and reducing manual work by ≈80% and reconciliation time by ≈60%.
	</li>
	<li>
		Optimized lists using RecyclerView + DiffUtil, delivering ≤16ms update renders (≈90% smoother UX).
	</li>
	<li>
		Modularized a 70+ file codebase, enabling 95% faster module updates and improving feature scalability and
		debugging efficiency.
	</li>
</ul>
